# Contributing

Contributions of fixes, examples, and clearer economic statements are welcome.
Submit only work you have the right to contribute. Original contributions are
accepted under the repository's Apache License 2.0. Identify any third-party
material and preserve its notices.

Every Lean file starts with the Apache copyright header that Mathlib's header
linter checks. State domains and assumptions explicitly, including the ones the
book leaves implicit (interiority, strict concavity, summability, no-Ponzi or
transversality conditions, stability). Do not use proof placeholders or add
axioms. Present values carry explicit `Summable` hypotheses rather than relying
on the junk value of `tsum`.

Run `python scripts/verify.py`: it builds the complete library, freshly
recompiles every contributed theorem, and checks its axiom dependencies. For
new modules or theorems, update `proof-manifest.json` and the README library
map in the same commit. Keep `docs/source-map.md` accurate: every book equation
or claim that is formalised appears there with its Lean name, and every place
where the Lean statement departs from the book is recorded in
`docs/corrections.md`.
